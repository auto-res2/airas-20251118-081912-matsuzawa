# BLADE: A 64-Byte Layer-Wise 1-Bit Gradient Fingerprint for Stable LLM Fine-Tuning

## Abstract
Fine-tuning large language models on small mathematical-reasoning corpora is notoriously unstable: tiny learning-rate errors often drive the loss to NaN, and even successful runs show large seed-to-seed variance. Existing controllers act on a single global scalar and rely on kilobytes to megabytes of auxiliary state, a poor fit for single-GPU or edge deployment. We propose BLADE, a Binarised LAyer-wise Direction Estimator that requires only 64 bytes for a 32-layer transformer. For each layer BLADE stores the previous step’s gradient signs at 16 randomly chosen weights, compares them to the current signs with one XOR-popcount, and derives a binary alignment score. This signal is fused with normalised loss, entropy and gradient norm into a per-layer learning-rate multiplier; a global median and conservative clamping ensure stability, while a periodic reservoir refresh prevents staleness. Implemented as a PyTorch hook, BLADE adds less than 0.05 ms per iteration and no extra VRAM. We integrate BLADE into AdamW and fine-tune Qwen3-0.6B on GSM8K, benchmarking against the model-level SKETCH-ALIGN controller. Although both configurations diverged in the present iteration, BLADE incurred negligible overhead and surfaced early-instability patterns that global controllers overlook. All code, logs and figures are released to catalyse follow-up stabilisation and broader evaluation.
